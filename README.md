# Brain
 Neural network simulation of human barain
Setting up a Web App with React, D3, and Three.js for Brain Simulation
Install Node.js and npm

Download and install Node.js from https://nodejs.org.

#Verify installation:
bash:
node -v  
npm -v  

#Fix PowerShell Script Execution Policy (if needed)

#Open PowerShell as Administrator and run:
bash

Set-ExecutionPolicy -Scope CurrentUser -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned

#Create a React App
Run the following in your terminal:

npx create-react-app brain-simulation

cd brain-simulation
#Install Required Libraries

Inside the project folder, install the required libraries:

npm install d3 three react-three-fiber @react-three/drei
#Set Up the Project Structure

Create the following folders/files in your src directory:
components/: To store React components.
utils/: For helper functions (like data parsing).
data/: Place your neuron dataset here.
Divide the Page Layout

#Edit App.js to include 3 sections:
Top Section: For checkboxes, dropdowns, and sliders.
Left Section: For additional filters and data selection.
Main Section: For visualizing neuron simulations using SVG and Three.js.
#Write the Code

Top Section: Add checkboxes, pulldowns, and sliders for time-step selection.
Left Section: Create five filter sections with sliders and checkboxes for data selection.
Main Section: Use D3 for 2D SVG visualization and Three.js for 3D simulations.
#Run Your App
Start the React development server:
npm start
Open http://localhost:3000 in your browser to see your app.
Optional: Debugging and Deployment

Use the React Developer Tools extension for debugging.
Deploy your app using services like Netlify, Vercel, or GitHub Pages.
